## Animal Cafe (demo)

A very small demo with a simple gameplay loop of serving different animals different types of requirements for a cafe. Written in Godot using .GD script.

The current build contains the following:
- Coffee serving
- Green tea serving
- Muffin heating 
- Multiple customers with random order requests
- Main gameplay loop
-	Money collection system
    
Everything within the current build is extremely alpha-level and does not reflect the finished product. Better practices and coding clean up is very much required. This build is extremely barebones POC.
